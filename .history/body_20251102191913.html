The application is architected as a self-contained, single-page application (SPA) within a single index.html file, deliberately avoiding modern JavaScript frameworks in favor of foundational web technologies. This vanilla approach utilizes pure JavaScript to manage the application state and simulate navigation by dynamically toggling the visibility of different content sections, creating a seamless user experience without page reloads. All dynamic content, such as the event listings and schedule, is rendered at runtime by JavaScript functions that directly manipulate the DOM. The distinct cyberpunk aesthetic is achieved through a hybrid styling strategy, leveraging the Tailwind CSS utility-first framework for layout and responsiveness, while layering custom CSS for unique visual effects like neon glows, semi-transparent "glassmorphism" panels with backdrop blurs, and themed interactive elements. All interactivity, from event filtering and modal pop-ups to form validation and submission, is handled through vanilla JavaScript event listeners, resulting in a lightweight, performant, and dependency-free web application that is both highly functional and visually immersive.
